# Flashcard-Generator
This was another exclusively server side assignment that once again used node and introduced constructors for the first time. It was a Flashcard Generator that would create two types of Flashcards. The first was basic in that you would see a question and then after a command you would enter the correct or incorrect answer. The Cloze card utilized inquirer much the same way as the Basic card did except in this case you would have to type in the correct answer and if the spelling or answer was wrong you would get a wrong answer console log. It was unique having to use console logs to display information to the user as they were normally only used for the developer to check if something was working correctly.If the user inputted a correct answer they would recieve a good console log and then get the next Flashcard. We used Constructors for the first time to create these flashcard and because I mis interpreted the directions I ended up doing a lot more than what I needed to to get an A on the assignment. It was interesting being able to generate these questions in server side so easily without having to use any HTML at all.
Tools used: Node.JS, Javascript, NPM packages.
